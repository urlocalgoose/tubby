The ancient well shelled
mariners sadly met their fate.

Hey everyone. Welcome back to my channel.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,600
Today I want to talk about the
Cambrin period. 500 million years ago,

4
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,560
the armored set ruled the seas.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,480
These animals secreted a mineral paste
that hardened into protective shells.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,480
Some of these shells were shaped
like Rams heads or eagles wings.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,600
Others were shaped like champagne
flutes, studded with dagger sharp spines.

8
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:34,400
But by the Devonian period,
70 million years later,

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:36,600
most of these animals were extinct.

10
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,120
They were victims of theft and their own
extravagant ways. That's all for today.
